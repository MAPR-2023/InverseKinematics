# InverseKinematics

this repository contains all the code pertaining to the inverse kinematics logic for the robotics side of my master thesis. 

- IK Unity is the unity project with a simulated robot arm where the angles are then sent via a usb serial port to the arm (final)
- use the unity package to include this version of the robot arm in your unity project
- IK master is a c++ program that simulates inverse kinematics (deprecated / unused)
- some models are included that are used for the IK in unity
